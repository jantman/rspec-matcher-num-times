This gem provides some rspec matchers to simplify asserting that something is included or matched N times.

## Installation

### Current Gem Version (for rspec-3)

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rspec-matcher-num-times'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec-matcher-num-times

### For rspec-2

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rspec-matcher-num-times', git: "https://github.com/jantman/rspec-matcher-num-times.git", branch: 'rspec2'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

In your spec_helper, add a line like:

    require 'rspec_matcher_num_times'

### Matchers

#### include_num_times

This matcher tests that a given item occurs N times in an array, or a given
substring occurs N times in a string.

    expect('foo bar foo').to include_num_times(2, 'foo')

    expect(['foo', 'bar', 'foo']).to include_num_times(2, 'foo')

#### match_num_times

This matcher tests that a given regex is matched N times in a string, or
that an array has N elements matching the regex.

    expect('ffooo bar foo').to match_num_times(2, /foo/)

    expect(['ffooo', 'bar', 'foo foo foo']).to include_num_times(2, /foo/)
